# To-Do List Project

This is only a self learning to-do list project. 
Project carried out with HTML5,CSS and Javascript.
I implemented the CRUD logic 

## TODO List

- [x] User can create task and add to the list
- [x] Users can view the list
- [x] Users can check the task or "marked" as done in the list
- [x] Users can delete the task from the list
